# Assets

This directory should contain the following image assets for the Expo app:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares for testing.

The app will work without these assets, but you may see warnings in the console.
